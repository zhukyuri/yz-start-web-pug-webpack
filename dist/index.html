		<div class="post-content"><h3>QUT IT Club & Networking Events</h3>
			<p>QUT IT Club is a QUT attliated club that aims to provide members with valuable
				experiences and social aspects that allow them to network with students, potential employees and
				industry experts.
				We host several events each semester for our students. We're also considered the largest IT club ran at
				QUT with
				an active paying member base of approximately 350 students that study not only IT, but Engineering, Law,
				Maths and
				Business disciplines. We have an ever increasing number of female members which is great not only for
				the
				ITIndustry but for our club's diversity and club focus. Students who join our club are usually attracted
				by the
				casual networking/social aspect or the experiences and official networking nights that we offer!</p>
			<p>This semester
				so far we have had a very successful Pc Building workshop(sponsored by MSY and a Social Event which
				overflowed
				the two rooms we had booked and a Bar Networking Night which allowed members to network in a more casual
				relaxed
				manner(without getting out of controln. We have an upcoming Networking Event for IT orientated companies
				offering
				graduate programs with companies such as Deloitte, Haltbrick, REA and Suncorp expressing interest in
				attendance!</p>
			<p>Regardless of this, we are always looking for companies willing to support us in a variety of ways so
				that QUT IT
				can expand and provide more valuable experiences for our students via collaboration, This not only
				increases
				awareness of your company to potential graduates but also allows your company direct engagement with our
				members
				be it by sponsoring our club, attending Networking Events and collaborating on events that provide
				experience to
				our students or even challenge them to hone their abilities. This not only gives companies access to our
				students,
				but lo a pool of graduates who are extremely interested in IT and motivated enough to gain experience,
				skills and
				knowledge that isn't compulsory to their course, by being an active member of our club, If you'd also
				like to
				take a further look at our student reach, feel tree to look at our two facebook
				groups (<a href="#">https://www.facebook.com/groupslqutit</a> &
				<a href="#">https//www.facebook.com/groups/qutisa</a>) with over 2.800 members and growing</p>
			<p>We are primarily looking for companies and organisations that have a strong investment in the IT industry
				that
				offer graduate programs or hire graduate students. However, we implore all companies interested to
				contact us
				regardless. We're also still looking for a few more companies to attend this semester's Networking
				event, ran on
				the 29th of April at 5pm.<br>
				If you are interested in attending our Networking Event, discussing collaboration,
				sponsorship or have any general enquiries please don't hesitate to contact met You can reach me(Jack
				Buckman) at
				our club email: club qutitclub.com</p></div>
